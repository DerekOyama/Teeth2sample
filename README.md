Copy of Teeth2 Game
This is a copy of Teeth2 as of 1/2/2023. The game is started as a project in Game Maker 2 using Game Maker Language (very similar to C++). The project was initially conceived by Max Adams in early 2022 and Derek Oyama later joined to assist in producing in spring of 2022. I (Derek) am responsible for all multiplayer integration and have learned, starting from no experience, through online research and experience gained from trial and error. 
Only a few temporary sound assets are from external sources. Everything in this project is meant to be developed from scratch from the ground up.
Eventually the full game will be available for free on steam. The release date is not yet determined.
